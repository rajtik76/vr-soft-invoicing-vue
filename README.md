# Invoice project

**This project is a part of my exercises to learn Vue 3 Composition API with TS üòÅ**

_Invoice project_ is SPA version with Vue of my previous [Invoicing project](https://github.com/rajtik76/Invoicing).  
I'm the only person who used it so that's why the relation between users table and other tables are not prefect as it
should be in the multi-user environment.  
I have a plan to fix that in the future.
